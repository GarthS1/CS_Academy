/*
You are given an integer NN that can be represented on 3232 bits. Implement a function that counts the numbers of bits set to 11 in NN's binary representation.

Desired solution
Try to find something faster than iterating through all the bits.

Standard input
The first line contains a single integer NN.

Standard output
Output a single number, representing the number of bits set to 11 in the binary representation.
